## Task management
To work with tasks use trello-proxy.js from "~/Projects/MCP/trello-api-proxy"
Board is https://trello.com/b/cHkkifBS/trello-api-proxy-tasts
List with tasks to do is called "ToDo"
List with completed tasks is called "Done"
You should usually take tasks from ToDo list unless told otherwise
When task completed: add summary comment (include steps taken) and mark as completed
Next task refers to first non-complted task in "ToDo" list
